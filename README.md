# SmartPrint by QuantaEdge

SmartPrint by QuantaEdge (QRtoPrint) is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for QR-initiated document printing, combining customer web experiences, a native Windows shop-management desktop application, a separate local Windows Print Agent service, and platform-owner administration.

## Product principles

- Support independent printing shops as the primary SaaS customer.
- Support both local shop-Wi-Fi printing and secure cloud-assisted printing.
- Integrate with multiple printer manufacturers through capability discovery and replaceable adapters.
- Keep print execution local to the shop; the cloud coordinates identity, tenancy, subscriptions, secure job routing, and optional cloud transfer.
- Keep each shop's customers, documents, jobs, payment records, devices, users, and branding isolated.
- Route customer print payments to the shop's own payment account. Route Smart Print SaaS subscription payments to the platform owner. These are separate financial flows.
- Deliver a premium, coherent, accessible UI across customer PWA, shop desktop/web, platform administration, and the Windows agent.

## Deployment origin

The application has one public origin, configured per deployment in PUBLIC_BASE_URL. The customer portal, shop portal, platform administration, API and station QR links all use that origin; do not add separate API or admin hostnames for this application. Set IMAGE_NAMESPACE in .env to the GHCR namespace that owns the API and portal images. Both values are required; neither has a baked-in production default.

## Repository status

The repository contains an integrated customer/shop portal, tenant-scoped ASP.NET Core API, PostgreSQL schema and migrations, paired Windows Print Agent, encrypted local print queue, spooler execution, automated tests and CI. Supported single-file PDF/JPG/JPEG/PNG jobs (20 MB hard limit, PDFs up to 500 pages) can be uploaded either through protected cloud storage or directly from the customer phone to the paired shop Agent over the shop LAN. Both modes create the same cloud-coordinated PrintJob and use the existing server quote, shop approval, manual shop payment verification, explicit dispatch and output-confirmation lifecycle. In direct LAN mode, document bytes remain on the shop network; the API retains only document metadata, SHA-256 and page analysis. The cloud remains required for QR-session validation, upload grants, metadata, quotes, payment and dispatch authorisation, so this is not offline printing. Platform-admin identity, read-only operations overview, tenant directory, versioned plans, entitlement enforcement and audited trial/free/operator-confirmed paid subscription assignment are implemented. Automated payment gateways, SaaS subscription invoices, refunds/reconciliation, multi-file/Office upload, Agent tray/auto-update and the physical-printer compatibility matrix remain future work. See docs/ROADMAP.md for scope and validation boundaries.

## Android companion (initial implementation)

A native Android client is located in `apps/android`. It complements the customer PWA rather than replacing the shared print workflow.

- Scan the existing shop QR code (`/s/{publicCode}`) in a branded CameraX preview using bundled on-device ML Kit. Release builds accept only HTTPS station URLs; debug builds additionally allow HTTP only for RFC1918 private IPv4 hosts on port 3000 for local LAN development. Camera frames stay on the device.
- Keep documents in app-private local storage with folders and subfolders. Import multiple files or an entire folder through Android's Storage Access Framework; export a file or folder back to a user-selected file-manager destination.
- Select a saved PDF/JPG/JPEG/PNG from the native library when the customer portal requests a file. The existing API limits printable documents to 20 MB and remains responsible for document analysis, quotes, shop approval, payment and job status.
- The embedded customer portal uses the same station-bound session and upload APIs as the web PWA. It does not introduce a second print-job lifecycle or claim offline printing.
- The local Agent upload exception permits only RFC1918 IPv4 addresses on TCP 17842 and the Agent upload route over cleartext HTTP; all other HTTP WebView requests are blocked. HTTPS remains required for the shop portal.
- General library imports are capped at 100 MB per file. The app does not request broad storage access; Android file/folder pickers control import and export.

CI builds the Android debug APK and runs JVM unit tests. A real-device matrix (QR scanning, file-provider interoperability, Android version coverage and shop-Wi-Fi Agent upload) is still required before production or Play Store release. The SmartPrint Android debug APK is published as the `smartprint-android-debug` workflow artifact.

## Public SmartPrint downloads

The public landing page reads the latest stable GitHub release metadata and renders a download link only when that exact release contains the corresponding binary:

- Windows shop installer: resolved from the latest published stable release metadata.
- Android customer APK: resolved from the latest published stable release metadata when that release contains the verified signed APK.

The Windows installer is intentionally unsigned for the interim beta channel. The website marks it **Available** only when the latest stable release actually contains the installer, and shows a short note that Windows may display a first-run security prompt. Some managed Windows 11 devices may block unsigned installers. Do not advise customers to disable Windows security protections. The Android card stays **Coming soon** until the production signing keystore is configured.

Every stable release is retained indefinitely as its own versioned GitHub Release; publishing a newer version updates the `latest` pointer but does not delete or replace older versions. The release workflow always verifies and publishes the Windows installer. When all four Android signing secrets are present, it also builds and verifies the signed Android APK and publishes it in the same release. If none of the Android secrets are configured, Android is skipped and its website card remains unavailable; a partially configured signing setup fails the release.

Create a version tag (for example, `v0.1.0`) only after the intended changes are merged to `main`, main-branch CI passes, and `SMARTPRINT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` matches the deployment. Configure all four Android signing secrets before expecting the signed APK to appear. The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow always builds and publishes the guided Windows installer; it also builds, verifies and publishes the Android APK when signing is configured.

Required GitHub Actions repository secrets for Android (not required for the Windows beta):

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded Android release keystore |
| `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Android keystore password |
| `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS` | Android release key alias |
| `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` | Android release key password |

Keep the Android keystore and its passwords backed up securely. Every Android update must use the same signing identity or existing installations will not accept it as an in-place update.

The future Microsoft Store channel will be a separate MSIX package, not the current EXE installer. Microsoft Store submissions of accepted MSIX packages are re-signed by Microsoft. Before Store submission, the current Windows Service and firewall installation architecture must be validated against MSIX packaging and restricted capabilities.

The release and CI workflows require the repository Actions variable `SMARTPRINT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. No production host fallback is embedded in the Gradle build or installer scripts; a missing or invalid value fails validation before packaging.

The guided **SmartPrint Desktop** installer does not ask the shop owner for a pairing code, API URL, or PowerShell command. After sign-in, the desktop requests a short-lived, single-use enrollment authorization from the authenticated shop API and sends it directly to the local Windows Agent over its ACL-protected, remote-client-rejecting named pipe. The Agent stores its device secret with DPAPI LocalMachine protection. For an existing pairing, startup checks the saved identity; an owner-revoked computer is not silently re-enrolled and requires one explicit **Reconnect this computer** action after the server confirms revocation. A computer paired to another active shop cannot be transferred until that shop revokes it. The separate **Agent-only/manual deployment** workflow below still uses a one-time code from **Shop workspace → Print Agent → Generate pairing code**; that code expires after 10 minutes. The guided installer stages Agent files in a version/build-specific folder, switches the Windows service only after the new files are present, and restores the previous executable path and running state if the new service cannot be started. Superseded Agent files are removed only after the replacement service and firewall rule are confirmed healthy.

## Download and install the Android debug APK

On Windows with GitHub CLI authenticated and Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed:

```powershell
.\scripts\download-android-apk.ps1
.\scripts\download-android-apk.ps1 -Install
.\scripts\download-android-apk.ps1 -Install -DeviceSerial "YOUR_DEVICE_SERIAL"
```

The script selects the latest successful main-branch CI run, downloads the `smartprint-android-debug` artifact, validates the APK and reports its SHA-256. It saves the file as `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\SmartPrintAndroid\SmartPrint-Android-debug.apk`. Use `-Install` only after enabling USB debugging and authorising the device. This is a development debug build, not a Play Store release.

The same CI run publishes `smartprint-android-test-reports` with JVM and emulator test evidence.

## Run locally through Cloudflare Tunnel

This is the recommended local end-to-end test path. The phone opens the same publicly trusted HTTPS URL as production; no private CA certificate is installed on customer devices.

1. In Cloudflare, create a named tunnel under **Networking → Tunnels**.
2. Add a **Published application** route for the hostname you want to use. Set its service URL to **http://portal:80** (the portal service inside the Docker network).
3. From the repository root, run:

    .\scripts\docker-up-local.ps1

   The helper reuses .env.local and the existing database/document volumes. It asks once for the tunnel connector token and stores it in the Git-ignored .secrets/cloudflare/tunnel-token file. The token is not printed or placed in the environment file.
4. The only application URL is PUBLIC_BASE_URL in .env.local. The helper asks for it when no value is configured; it has no domain fallback. The portal and API share this hostname; Nginx routes /api and /health internally to the API.

The phone opens that Cloudflare HTTPS URL. When the customer taps Check shop Wi-Fi, Chrome may request Local Network Access permission for the shop computer. No certificate installation is required. Cloud-assisted upload remains available when local access is unavailable.

### Standalone Agent-only pairing (manual deployment)

Use this only when deploying the Agent without the guided SmartPrint Desktop installer. Pair it against the same public URL and configure its browser origin with the same value:

    $agentDir = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE "Downloads\QRtoPrintAgent"
    $agentExe = Join-Path $agentDir "SmartPrint.Agent.exe"
    $publicBaseUrl = (Get-Content .env.local | Where-Object { $_ -like "PUBLIC_BASE_URL=*" } | Select-Object -First 1).Substring("PUBLIC_BASE_URL=".Length)
    & "$agentDir\pair-agent.ps1" -ApiBaseUrl $publicBaseUrl -AgentExePath $agentExe
    & "$agentDir\install-agent-service.ps1" -AgentExePath $agentExe -CustomerPortalOrigin $publicBaseUrl

Use the current PUBLIC_BASE_URL in those commands. After its first authenticated heartbeat, the Agent receives the canonical origin from the API and updates its saved API destination and allowed browser origin without changing its DPAPI-protected pairing identity.

### Changing the public URL later

Change PUBLIC_BASE_URL in .env.local (or .env for production), update the matching exact-hostname Published application route in Cloudflare to http://portal:80, and restart the Compose stack. Cloudflare's route is infrastructure configuration and must match the chosen hostname. Keep the previous hostname routed to the same portal during migration: previously printed QR codes keep working, and already-paired Agents can heartbeat through the old hostname and learn the new URL. Remove the old route only after Agents have updated and old QR codes are no longer in circulation.

### Stop / restart

Stop containers without deleting data:

    docker compose --env-file .env.local -f compose.local.yml down

Restart with .\scripts\docker-up-local.ps1. Never use down -v; that deletes persistent application data.

## Docker deployment

The production stack runs PostgreSQL, the ASP.NET Core API, the React portal and a Cloudflare Tunnel connector. The connector makes outbound connections to Cloudflare; the host does not need inbound ports 80/443, a public IP, a Caddy certificate, or a separate API hostname.

### First start

1. In Cloudflare, create a named tunnel and add a Published application route for the chosen hostname. Set the service URL to **http://portal:80**.
2. From the repository directory, run:

    .\scripts\docker-up.ps1

   The helper creates .env with fresh database, signing and document-encryption secrets, prompts once for the tunnel token, and stores it under the Git-ignored .secrets/cloudflare/ directory. It pulls the published GHCR images and preserves named data volumes.
3. Open the URL printed by the script. The same PUBLIC_BASE_URL serves the portal, API and newly generated station QR links.

### One place to change the URL

PUBLIC_BASE_URL in .env is the sole public application origin. It must be an HTTPS origin with no path. The Cloudflare Published application route for that hostname must point to http://portal:80. Browser API calls are same-origin through /api; no API_DOMAIN is required.

### First administrator

After the first deployment is healthy, bootstrap the separate platform administrator:

    .\scripts\docker-bootstrap-platform-admin.ps1 -Email "admin@example.com" -DisplayName "Platform Administrator"

The script prompts securely for a password and creates or repairs only a tenantless platform-admin identity. It refuses to elevate an existing shop user.

### Windows printer computer

Install the Windows Agent on the computer physically connected to the printer. Pair it with PUBLIC_BASE_URL and install the Windows Service using the exact same customer origin. The Agent learns later URL changes from the authenticated heartbeat and updates its API destination and local CORS allowlist without re-pairing.

During a hostname migration, keep every previously configured public or legacy Agent API hostname routed to the portal until Agents have updated and old QR codes are no longer in circulation. Legacy Agent heartbeats must continue to reach the API long enough to receive the new canonical URL.

Direct LAN uploads still require the phone and Agent to share the shop LAN, the browser's Local Network Access permission when requested, and the Agent's Private-profile firewall rule on TCP 17842. Cloud-assisted upload remains the fallback.

### Backups and operations

Before upgrades or migrations, run .\scripts\docker-backup.ps1. Database backups, encrypted document files and their encryption key must be kept together. Restore using .\scripts\docker-restore.ps1 -BackupDirectory .\backups -ConfirmRestore.

Inspect the deployment with docker compose --env-file .env -f compose.yml ps and docker compose --env-file .env -f compose.yml logs -f api. The stop script preserves named volumes. Never use docker compose down -v unless you deliberately intend to delete application data.

## Delivery principles

- Audit the current state before changing existing functionality.
- Keep the default branch buildable; use focused, reviewable changes.
- Never claim a physical print completed based only on spooler acceptance.
- Never automatically resubmit an uncertain physical print after restart.
- Never trust client-supplied prices or payment-success screenshots.
- Do not claim hardware compatibility until representative physical devices have been tested.


Platform administrators can manage versioned SaaS plans and grant published trial, free or paid versions to shops. Paid access can be granted after an operator confirms the funds were received and records the bank/UPI transaction reference; the granting actor and amount are kept in the append-only assignment audit. Automated gateway checkout, subscription invoices and payment reconciliation remain future work.
