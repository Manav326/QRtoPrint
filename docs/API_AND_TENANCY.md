# API and Tenant Foundation

## Implemented API surface

### Shop registration and authentication

- POST /api/v1/auth/register-shop — atomically provisions a tenant, shop profile, 14-day trial subscription and first shop-owner identity.
- POST /api/v1/auth/login — validates credentials with ASP.NET Core Identity lockout policy and issues short-lived bearer access plus rotating refresh token.
- POST /api/v1/auth/refresh — atomically consumes a refresh token and rotates it.
- POST /api/v1/auth/logout — revokes the supplied refresh token.

Passwords are handled by ASP.NET Core Identity's password hasher and validation policy. Access tokens are signed JWTs. Set a unique signing key in each environment; the development fallback must never be used in production.

### Shop operations reports

- GET /api/v1/shop/reports/summary?days=7|30|90 — returns a summary scoped to the authenticated shop. The default period is 30 days; unsupported period values are rejected.
- Job totals and status breakdown use jobs created inside the selected UTC window. `completedJobs` counts only jobs in `COMPLETED` with an operator-recorded `OutputConfirmedUtc`; `pagesRequested` is page count multiplied by requested copies and is not a claim of physical output.
- Verified collections are grouped by currency and payment method and use `VerifiedUtc` within the selected window. UPI references that have not been independently verified by the shop are excluded. The pending-payment count includes all currently open UPI/cash attempts for the tenant, regardless of creation date, so an old unresolved payment never disappears from the operator's review count.

### Platform administration

Platform administrator accounts are provisioned offline using `scripts/bootstrap-platform-admin.ps1`. After database migrations and production database/signing-key configuration are in place, run `scripts\bootstrap-platform-admin.ps1 -Email "owner@example.com" -DisplayName "Platform Administrator"` from PowerShell. The script prompts for the password as a secure input and passes it to a one-time local API bootstrap command; it does not store the password in the repository. A bootstrap operation refuses to elevate an account that already belongs to a shop. Platform accounts have no `TenantId` and receive a dedicated `platform_role=PlatformAdmin` user claim. Shop routes remain separately tenant-scoped.

- GET /api/v1/platform/overview — returns aggregate tenant, subscription, printer, agent and recent job counts. It does not expose customer documents or payment credentials.
- GET /api/v1/platform/tenants?search=&status=&page=1&pageSize=25 — returns a paginated tenant directory with shop status, latest subscription metadata, printer/agent counts and recent job volume. Search is limited to shop business name and slug.

These routes require the platform-admin authorization policy. A shop user cannot access them, even if a platform claim is mistakenly added to a tenant-scoped token.

### Platform subscription plan catalogue

Platform-admin-only plan management is available under the same unscoped platform authorization policy:

- GET /api/v1/platform/plans — lists plans and their version history.
- POST /api/v1/platform/plans — creates a non-system plan and its first draft version.
- PUT /api/v1/platform/plans/{planId} — updates plan metadata and whether it is available for future assignment.
- PUT /api/v1/platform/plans/{planId}/draft — saves the current draft or starts the next version; published versions are never edited in place.
- POST /api/v1/platform/plans/{planId}/versions/{versionNumber}/publish — publishes a draft only after at least one monthly or annual price is explicitly set. Zero is a valid explicit free price.

Prices are integer minor currency units with a required three-letter currency code. A blank price means that billing interval is not configured; zero explicitly means free. Nullable quotas mean no configured cap; positive integer quotas cover printers, agent computers, QR stations, monthly print jobs and maximum document bytes. Feature flags are centrally stored for cloud-assisted printing, white-label and advanced reports.

Configured limits are enforced at shop and customer API boundaries. This covers printer creation and agent printer discovery sync, paired Windows computers, QR station creation, monthly print-job creation, document-size limits and cloud-assisted customer upload. Monthly job usage uses the UTC calendar month. A transaction-scoped PostgreSQL advisory lock serializes each tenant/resource count-and-create operation so concurrent requests do not race past the same quota. The cloud upload path checks its feature entitlement and maximum file size before storage.

White-label and advanced-report switches are stored in published versions but are not yet wired to separate runtime feature routes. Existing subscriptions without a PlanVersionId remain unrestricted for compatibility until terms are explicitly assigned. Creating or publishing a plan does not assign it to a shop.

Plan versions are immutable after publication. A subscription's nullable PlanVersionId references the exact version used for its terms. The additive migration seeds a protected TRIAL plan/version and maps existing TRIAL subscriptions to it without adding a price or a quota. The TRIAL code and system plan are not editable through the catalogue. Legacy non-trial subscription rows remain valid with a null PlanVersionId pending an explicit migration/assignment policy.

The catalogue is a configuration foundation, not a payment implementation. Publishing a plan does not bill a shop or assign a subscription; plan assignment, runtime quota enforcement, subscription invoices, platform payment reconciliation, renewals, dunning and refunds remain separate work. Do not use shop-owned print-payment settings or records for SaaS subscription charges.

### Platform subscription administration

- GET /api/v1/platform/subscriptions — paginated, searchable tenant/subscription directory with the latest assigned published plan version and current billing period.
- POST /api/v1/platform/tenants/{tenantId}/subscriptions — platform-admin-only assignment of the protected 14-day trial, an explicitly free published plan, or a paid published plan after the operator confirms receipt and supplies the bank/UPI transaction reference.
- GET /api/v1/platform/tenants/{tenantId}/subscription-history — immutable assignment history including reason, actor, plan version, period, payment reference and idempotency key.
- Every assignment appends a subscription row and a separate append-only audit event. The previous row is marked Superseded, while its previous status is preserved in the audit event; no prior subscription row is deleted.
- Paid monthly/annual grants require an authenticated platform-admin confirmation and a 4–100 character transaction reference. The API snapshots the published plan amount/currency and records the granting actor; the operator must check the actual platform payment account before confirming receipt.
- Every grant requires an explicit reason and an idempotency key. Retries return the original result rather than creating a second subscription.

### Shop subscription visibility

- GET /api/v1/shop/subscription — returns only the authenticated tenant's latest subscription, linked plan-version terms, effective entitlements and current resource usage. The endpoint never accepts a tenant ID from the caller.
- Usage counts include all shop printers and QR stations, active paired agent computers and print jobs created in the current UTC calendar month.
- Prices are returned as configured minor currency units. This is a read-only summary; shops cannot edit their plan, set their own limits, or initiate/confirm a subscription payment from this endpoint.
- This is the platform subscription flow, not customer print payments. UPI/cash collected by a shop for a customer's print job remains separate.

### Authenticated shop endpoints

- GET /api/v1/shop/profile
- PUT /api/v1/shop/profile (shop owner/manager)
- GET /api/v1/shop/printers
- POST /api/v1/shop/printers (shop owner/manager)
- PATCH /api/v1/shop/printers/{printerId}/active (shop owner/manager)
- GET /api/v1/shop/qr-stations
- POST /api/v1/shop/qr-stations (shop owner/manager)
- GET /api/v1/shop/pricing
- PUT /api/v1/shop/pricing (shop owner/manager)
- GET /api/v1/shop/print-jobs (latest 100 jobs)

Tenant IDs are derived from the authenticated token. Printer IDs supplied for station assignment are checked against the same tenant. Printer status is server-owned and starts as Unknown.

### Public QR session endpoints

- POST /api/v1/public/stations/{publicCode}/sessions — exchanges a public station identifier for a short-lived customer session.
- GET /api/v1/public/sessions/current — reads session/shop context using the X-Print-Session header.

Static QR codes are identifiers only. The API stores only a hash of the public station code and returns a random short-lived session token once. Session lifetime is currently 15 minutes. QR session creation is rate-limited.

## Data model

The initial PostgreSQL migration creates Identity tables and tenant-scoped tenants, shop profiles, subscriptions, printers, QR stations, customer sessions, refresh tokens and print-job metadata. Tenant-owned queries include an explicit tenant predicate; API resource identifiers are never treated as authorisation.

## Database setup

Set ConnectionStrings:SmartPrint and Authentication:SigningKey using environment variables or a secret store. Apply migrations using the scripts/migrate-database.ps1 PowerShell script.

ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development uses a local PostgreSQL connection fallback for developer convenience. The API does not automatically mutate a database by default; the Docker Compose deployment explicitly sets `Database:ApplyMigrationsOnStartup=true`, so the API applies pending migrations after PostgreSQL is healthy. /health/live is process health; /health/ready verifies database connectivity.

## Current boundary

The customer print workflow supports two document-transfer modes and one shared job/payment lifecycle:

- **Direct shop-Wi-Fi upload:** the customer phone sends one supported PDF/JPG/PNG document directly to the paired Windows Agent on the shop LAN. The Agent validates the signature, SHA-256, file size and page analysis, then stores the file in its DPAPI LocalMachine-protected queue. The cloud API stores only metadata and the expected content hash; it does not receive the document bytes or create a cloud document object.
- **Cloud-assisted upload:** the customer sends the file to the public API, which validates and stores it in protected cloud document storage. The assigned Agent later retrieves the document over its authenticated cloud connection into the same protected local queue.

Both modes use the same tenant-scoped PrintJob, server-calculated quote, customer quote acceptance, shop approval, UPI/cash payment attempt, manual shop payment verification, explicit dispatch, spooler reconciliation and shop-confirmed physical-output state. A local-only document is locked to the paired Agent and printer that received it and cannot be downloaded from cloud storage or reassigned to another Agent. A shop operator must still confirm the actual paper output. Direct LAN transfer does not mean offline quote/payment operation: the API remains the control plane for job creation, quote, payment and dispatch.

## Quote acceptance and shop review

- POST /api/v1/public/jobs — accepts one multipart document for the active QR session and creates a job in AWAITING_CONFIGURATION. Uploads are subject to the shop's cloud-assisted-printing entitlement, configured maximum size, monthly job quota and upload validation limits.
- POST /api/v1/public/jobs/{jobId}/quote — calculates a quote from the shop's current pricing and the requested print settings. A new quote is accepted only for a newly uploaded job or a job whose previous quote expired.
- POST /api/v1/public/jobs/{jobId}/accept-quote — accepts a current quote from the same unexpired customer session and advances it to shop review.
- GET /api/v1/public/jobs/{jobId}/status — returns status and a customer-safe event timeline only to the active customer session that created the job.
- POST /api/v1/shop/print-jobs/{jobId}/approve — shop owner/manager approval advances the request to AWAITING_PAYMENT, never directly to printing.
- POST /api/v1/shop/print-jobs/{jobId}/reject — rejects a customer-accepted request awaiting shop review.
- GET /api/v1/shop/print-jobs/{jobId}/document — tenant-authorised preview for cloud-stored documents. A `LOCAL_AGENT` document returns `409 document_stored_on_local_agent`; its bytes intentionally remain on the assigned shop computer.

Customer print payments use the shop's UPI/cash settings and require a separate manual verification action by the shop. Shop approval alone neither proves payment nor authorises physical print execution.


## Job event history

Every important job transition is written to the tenant-scoped PrintJobEvents table with previous/new status, actor category, reason code and timestamp. A composite database relationship ensures an event cannot be attached to a job in another tenant.

- GET /api/v1/shop/print-jobs/{jobId}/events — shop-side event history for the authenticated tenant.
- GET /api/v1/public/jobs/{jobId}/status — current job state and a customer-safe timeline for the active session that created the job.

Events cover document upload, quote creation and expiry, customer quote acceptance, shop approval/rejection, manual payment verification, printer assignment and dispatch, agent claim and local receipt, spooler submission/status outcomes, pre-submission blocking, uncertain output and shop-confirmed physical completion. Event history is an operational audit trail; it does not turn spooler status into proof that paper was produced.


## Windows agent pairing and discovery

- POST /api/v1/shop/agent-enrollment-codes — shop owner/manager issues a 10-minute, single-use pairing code.
- GET /api/v1/shop/agent-devices — lists paired agent computers and discovered printer counts.
- PATCH /api/v1/shop/agent-devices/{agentId}/revoke — revokes an agent identity and marks its discovered printers as agent-revoked.
- POST /api/v1/agent/enroll — consumes a single-use code and returns a one-time secret. The server stores only the secret hash.
- POST /api/v1/agent/heartbeat — records a paired agent's last contact.
- POST /api/v1/agent/printers/sync — upserts Windows printer queues for the authenticated agent and marks missing queues unavailable.

Agent authentication uses a per-computer random secret over HTTPS. The Windows client stores the secret using DPAPI LocalMachine encryption. A revoked computer cannot continue to sync. Revoked fingerprints may be enrolled again after revocation; a second active pairing for the same machine/shop is blocked.

The Windows Agent also exposes a read-only local status endpoint at `http://<private-LAN-IPv4>:17842/api/v1/local/status`. Its CORS allowlist is configured through `Agent:LocalApi:AllowedOrigins`; the installer allows TCP 17842 through Windows Firewall on the Private profile only. The endpoint returns only the agent ID, protocol version and readiness state. The authenticated heartbeat publishes validated RFC1918 IPv4 endpoints, and QR session responses include them only when the station's assigned printer belongs to a recently online, non-revoked agent.

The customer portal checks the browser's granular `local-network` permission and does not probe while that permission is still awaiting a user decision. The first status request is triggered by the customer's explicit **Check shop Wi-Fi** action; a previously granted permission may be reused automatically. The request uses `targetAddressSpace: "local"` and standard exact-origin CORS. The page must be served from a secure HTTPS context in production.

Direct LAN upload uses these endpoints:

- POST `/api/v1/public/sessions/current/local-upload-tickets` — customer-session-scoped, idempotent ticket. The API stores only file metadata, expected SHA-256, a one-way hash of the random upload grant, fixed QR station/printer/Agent ownership and a 15-minute expiry.
- POST `/api/v1/local/uploads/{ticketId}` — same-LAN Agent endpoint. It forwards the grant to the API for Agent identity validation, checks the received file hash, analyses PDF/JPG/PNG with the shared document analyser, and stores the document encrypted with DPAPI LocalMachine.
- POST `/api/v1/agent/local-uploads/{ticketId}/claim` and `/complete` — Agent-authenticated cloud callbacks. Completion creates the normal tenant-scoped PrintJob and PrintDocument metadata with `StorageMode=LOCAL_AGENT`; document bytes are never uploaded to cloud storage.
- The local document remains bound to the original paired Agent and printer. After shop approval and manual payment verification, that same Agent claims the paid job, refreshes stored print settings, acknowledges local receipt and continues through the existing print-dispatch/spooler/output-confirmation flow. A LOCAL_AGENT document cannot be reassigned or fetched from the cloud.
- Cloud-assisted upload remains available as a customer-selected alternative. Direct LAN upload requires a secure HTTPS portal origin, user-granted Local Network Access permission and exact `Agent:LocalApi:AllowedOrigins` configuration. The installer sets the portal origin through `-CustomerPortalOrigin`.

The Windows Agent is not inventory-only. For cloud-stored jobs it retrieves the original document over its authenticated channel; for LAN-only jobs it reuses the already staged local document and never requests a cloud download. In both cases it verifies SHA-256 and size, acknowledges local receipt only after the protected file exists, and submits only jobs explicitly authorised by the shop after verified payment. It reports spooler state and uncertain outcomes to the API. It does not capture payments or infer that a spooler-accepted job has physically completed. The durable queue, print submission and output-reconciliation lifecycle is described below.


## Shop-owned print payments

Print payment records are tenant-scoped and linked to the originating print job through a composite foreign key. Each job may have only one active payment attempt at a time. Shop payment settings contain the shop's own UPI payee ID/name and whether cash at counter is enabled. These are separate from Smart Print platform subscription billing.

- GET/PUT /api/v1/shop/payment-settings — read/update shop UPI and cash options.
- GET /api/v1/shop/payments — list the latest 100 payment attempts for the authenticated shop.
- POST /api/v1/shop/payments/{paymentId}/verify — owner/manager marks a UPI reference verified or cash physically received. This is an explicit manual action.
- POST /api/v1/shop/payments/{paymentId}/reject — owner/manager rejects an active attempt with a reason.
- POST /api/v1/public/jobs/{jobId}/payments — customer starts an enabled UPI or cash attempt after shop approval.
- POST /api/v1/public/payments/{paymentId}/report — customer submits a UPI reference/UTR. This never marks the payment as paid.

UPI uses a shop-owned UPI ID and payment-intent URI/QR. The platform does not collect customer funds, call a payment gateway, or trust client screenshots/references as proof. The shop must independently verify receipt in its own bank/UPI app. When verification succeeds, the job becomes PAID_AUTHORISED and may proceed through printer assignment, authenticated agent claim, verified local receipt and explicit shop dispatch. Physical printing is performed by the paired Windows Agent, not by the cloud API. Smart Print SaaS subscription payments are independent.


## Customer session recovery

- POST /api/v1/public/sessions/current/resume — accepts the existing X-Print-Session token plus the QR station's public code. It resumes only an unexpired, active session belonging to that same enabled station and tenant, and returns the same session token, shop identity, payment options and assigned printer.
- POST /api/v1/public/sessions/current/renew — renews an active, unrevoked, not-yet-expired session. If expiry is within 10 minutes, it extends expiry to 15 minutes from the renewal time; it cannot revive an already expired or revoked session.
- While the customer print page is active, the portal attempts renewal every five minutes and also checks on page focus/visibility resume when expiry is approaching. A transient renewal failure is retried on a later heartbeat; an expired session must enter the normal QR session flow again.
- If the stored token is expired, revoked, belongs to another station, or the QR station has been disabled, the customer app discards it and creates a fresh session through the normal QR entry route.
- The customer app stores only the opaque active session token and print-job metadata/quote in sessionStorage for the current browser tab. Uploaded document bytes remain on the API's protected storage; they are not copied into browser storage. On reload, the app re-reads job status, timeline and payment status from the API rather than trusting cached payment state.
- Session storage is tab-scoped and is not a permanent customer account or cross-device recovery mechanism. The 15-minute expiry still applies when a customer page is not actively renewing the session.


Payment verification, rejection and UPI reference submission use an optimistic concurrency token on each payment row. If two customer/shop actions race, only the first update can persist; the losing request receives HTTP 409 with `payment_state_changed` and must refresh. Payment state, job state and the corresponding audit event are saved together for shop verification/rejection.


## Agent local queue handoff

After shop-side manual payment verification, an owner/manager assigns the job to a printer queue reported by an online paired Windows agent.

- PATCH /api/v1/shop/print-jobs/{jobId}/printer — assigns a paid/authorised job to an active printer queue on a paired, recently online agent. An expired local-queue claim can be reassigned; a job already secured locally cannot be silently moved.
- POST /api/v1/agent/jobs/claim — an authenticated agent claims up to five paid jobs assigned to one of its own live queues. The server grants a three-minute lease and records the claiming agent.
- GET /api/v1/agent/jobs/{jobId}/document — streams the decrypted original only to the paired agent holding the active job lease. Responses are non-cacheable and carry the source SHA-256 and size.
- POST /api/v1/agent/jobs/{jobId}/received — confirms the local agent has stored the exact original (matching the server SHA-256 and byte count). This acknowledgement is idempotent for the same agent.

The Windows agent stores the document encrypted with DPAPI LocalMachine under its protected ProgramData queue directory. Its manifest tracks ACK_PENDING and ACKNOWLEDGED so an interrupted acknowledgement is retried after restart. Temporary and orphaned files are cleaned during service startup. The cloud status changes to LOCAL_QUEUE_READY only after the agent confirms verified local storage.

A secured local copy is not proof of spooler acceptance or paper output. Physical spooler acceptance is still distinct from actual paper completion; only a shop operator can confirm output after inspecting the sheets.


## Physical printing and output reconciliation

Physical printing is a local Windows Agent action, never a cloud-to-printer command.

- POST /api/v1/shop/print-jobs/{jobId}/dispatch — owner-authorised action available only after verified payment, secure local receipt, and a live assigned queue. It changes LOCAL_QUEUE_READY to PRINT_AUTHORISED and creates a stable per-job spooler document name.
- POST /api/v1/agent/jobs/print-claim — the paired agent proves the locally stored SHA-256/size and claims only explicitly authorised jobs for its own live queue. The five-minute lease is re-claimable by that same agent only when expired and its local manifest still proves no submission started.
- POST /api/v1/agent/jobs/{jobId}/spooler-accepted — records Windows spooler job ID/name after GDI EndDoc succeeds. The stable document name supports restart reconciliation.
- POST /api/v1/agent/jobs/{jobId}/spooler-status — records queue status and page counters. Spooler status never automatically changes the job to COMPLETED.
- POST /api/v1/agent/jobs/{jobId}/print-blocked — returns a failure known to have occurred before StartDoc to LOCAL_QUEUE_READY so the shop can correct the issue and explicitly retry.
- POST /api/v1/agent/jobs/{jobId}/output-unconfirmed — records a post-submission uncertain outcome and permanently blocks automatic resubmission.
- POST /api/v1/shop/print-jobs/{jobId}/confirm-output — owner confirms the actual paper output only after inspecting the physical pages; then the job becomes COMPLETED.

The Windows Agent rasterises PDFs with PDFium and JPEG/PNG with SkiaSharp, validates A4/A5/Letter/Legal paper availability, colour and duplex support against the installed driver, and uses Windows GDI/Print Spooler. Requested copies are expanded in software as collated copies so the driver cannot multiply them a second time. Unsupported settings are blocked before StartDoc.

The durable local manifest is written as SUBMITTING before the first spooler call. After an agent restart it searches the spooler by the stable document name. If a matching spooler job exists it records the existing job; if the outcome cannot be proven, the job is marked OUTPUT_UNCONFIRMED. The system never automatically submits again after a submission may have begun.

Spooler acceptance or disappearance from the Windows queue is not proof of physical paper output. Actual hardware behaviour still requires validation against the shop's specific printer models and installed drivers.
