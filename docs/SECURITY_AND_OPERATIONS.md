# Security and Operations

## 1. Tenant and identity security

- Derive tenant scope from verified user membership or registered device identity.
- Enforce tenant checks for every API operation, file, job, printer, payment and report.
- Use role-based permissions for owner, manager, operator and reporting roles.
- Require strong authentication for shop owners and platform administrators; support MFA.
- Apply rate limits and abuse controls to QR sessions, uploads, login, quotes and payment callbacks.
- Audit role changes, refunds, overrides, retries, data exports and support access.

## 1A. Tenant lifecycle and subscription enforcement

- Tenant state is controlled through the platform-only `PATCH /api/v1/platform/tenants/{tenantId}/status` endpoint. The platform administrator must provide a 5–500 character reason; the actor, previous status, new status and timestamp are persisted in `TenantStatusAudits`.
- Supported transitions are Active → Suspended/Inactive and Suspended → Active/Inactive. Inactive is terminal; reactivation is not supported.
- Suspension blocks new QR sessions, print submissions, quotes, payment starts, new Agent claims and new authorisation/dispatch actions. Read-only history and limited recovery operations remain available so already-paid or physically submitted jobs can be reconciled, refunded, rejected or confirmed.
- The shop API enforces subscription access and feature entitlements server-side. Portal navigation is not an enforcement boundary.
- API rate limits use source-IP partitions so clients cannot bypass them by changing untrusted session or Agent headers. The current defaults are 20 authentication requests/minute, 120 public requests/minute, 30 Agent requests/minute, 30 QR session creations/minute and 8 document uploads/minute. Review these values against production traffic and trusted proxy configuration.

## 2. QR session security

A printed QR identifies a shop station; it does not authorise printing by itself. On scan, issue a short-lived, random, scoped session bound to tenant/station and validated by the local edge or cloud. Support expiry, revocation, rotation, abuse limits and replay protection. Do not embed long-lived secrets or customer data in static QR codes.

## 3. Document and file security

- Allowlist file formats and validate signatures, not only extensions.
- Enforce file size, page count, decompression and processing-time limits.
- Store files outside public web roots; use opaque identifiers and short-lived authorised access.
- Encrypt cloud documents at rest using AES-256-GCM with a deployment-specific 32-byte key; protect the key in the deployment secret store.
- For direct LAN uploads, issue a random one-use grant bound to the live QR session, tenant, station, assigned Agent/printer, filename, byte count and SHA-256. Persist only a hash of the grant in the API.
- Accept the document only at the exact private-LAN Agent, verify grant ownership with the cloud API, enforce a 20 MB transfer ceiling and analyse the actual document signature/content before storing.
- Store received Agent documents and the Windows Agent identity with DPAPI LocalMachine; protect the queue directory with SYSTEM/Administrators-only Windows ACLs. Never return a local-only document through cloud document-preview/download endpoints.
- The document storage format is versioned (`QSP1`); never reuse the development key in production.
- Scan uploads where configured and isolate conversion/rendering processes.
- Apply explicit retention and deletion policies. Never log document contents or public file URLs.
- Cloud print documents are purged 30 days after confirmed completion by default. Set `Documents:RetentionDays` (7–3650 days) or `DOCUMENTS_RETENTION_DAYS` in Compose to change the period. The database retains job, payment and refund metadata and marks purged documents with `PurgedUtc`; subsequent cloud preview/download returns HTTP 410.
- The Windows Agent runs a six-hour retention sweep. Expired, unfinalised local uploads are removed; local source documents and managed PDF exports are purged 30 days after operator-confirmed physical output or a reported PDF export by default. Configure `Agent:CompletedDocumentRetentionDays` (7–3650 days). Output-unconfirmed jobs are never automatically purged.
- The API performs daily cleanup of old expired local-upload tickets, old empty customer sessions and expired/revoked refresh tokens. Historical print jobs, payment events, refund events and tenant audit history are retained.
- Both cloud and local customer upload paths share the 20-file / 50-MB batch limit. Local upload reservations are serialized with the tenant's monthly print-job quota lock; expired, uncompleted reservations no longer consume capacity.
- Collection reports record gross payments in the payment verification period and refunds in the period when the shop records that the refund was actually sent. A later refund does not rewrite the earlier gross collection period.

- Prevent path traversal, archive bombs, malicious Office content and unsafe preview rendering.

## 4. Payments and financial integrity

- Verify automated gateway payment status server-side using signed webhooks and/or provider APIs.
- For a manually confirmed SaaS subscription payment, require a platform administrator to check the actual platform account receipt, enter the bank/UPI transaction reference, and grant the plan through the audited platform endpoint. The API snapshots the published amount/currency, operator and reference; never accept a shop customer's success screen or client-supplied payment flag as proof.
- Enforce idempotency for order creation, capture, refund and webhook processing.
- Store immutable quote, tax, currency and payment snapshots.
- Separate customer print payment flows from SaaS subscription billing.
- Reconcile gateway transactions and internal ledgers; never accept a client success screen as proof.
- Refunds and manual cash overrides require permission and audit trail.

## 5. Physical print safety

- Persist job intent and submission attempt before spooler side effects.
- Never automatically resubmit a job whose physical output is uncertain.
- Distinguish queued, submitted, spooler accepted, printing, completed and output unconfirmed.
- Operator retry must explain duplicate risk and require explicit confirmation where appropriate.
- Do not claim physical completion when the printer only confirms spooler acceptance.

## 6. Offline, backup and recovery

- Local authorised jobs should continue during temporary internet outages.
- Current limitation: direct LAN document upload and local Agent status/preview communication use private-network HTTP. CORS, one-use grants, ownership checks and hashes do not encrypt the document bytes in transit. Until end-to-end local payload encryption or trusted HTTPS is implemented and tested, treat the shop LAN as a trusted, segmented network and do not use this path on guest/public Wi-Fi.
- Current limitation: the Windows Agent installer does not yet configure a dedicated least-privilege service identity. Validate the service account and printer permissions before production deployment.
- Local queue and event journal must be durable across process and machine restart.
- Define recovery and reconciliation for interrupted uploads, conversion, payment, spooler submission and sync.
- Provide encrypted backup/restore for local configuration and metadata; document customer document retention separately.
- Subscription expiry must not delete tenant data or interrupt a physical job already in progress.
- Offline grace duration and restrictions are configurable product policy, not a hidden constant.

## 7. Privacy and support

Platform support access to tenant records must be least-privilege, time-bound, purpose-bound and audited. Document access should be exceptional and consent/contract governed. Retention, deletion, export and incident response must be documented before production launch.

## 8. Release operations

- Deploy PostgreSQL, API, portal and the Cloudflare Tunnel connector through the versioned Docker Compose stack. Keep database and encrypted document volumes persistent; store the remotely-managed tunnel token in the Git-ignored .secrets/cloudflare/tunnel-token Docker secret file. The public portal and API share PUBLIC_BASE_URL and do not require inbound host ports or a local TLS certificate.
- Keep the Windows Print Agent on the printer-connected shop computer; it is not run in the Linux API container.
- Preserve the exact `.env` secrets and back up PostgreSQL and cloud document storage together before upgrades/migrations; test restore procedures.
- Sign Windows installers and agent updates.
- Use staged release channels and rollback-capable updates.
- Verify update signatures before installation.
- Preserve queue state and local configuration during upgrade.
- Publish checksums and release notes.
- Provide diagnostics bundle export with secrets and document contents redacted.
- Current backup scripts restrict local filesystem ACLs but do not encrypt the generated database dump, document archive or secrets file themselves. Encrypt the complete three-file backup set before transferring it to off-host storage. Perform and record restore drills; do not assume successful backup creation proves recoverability.
- Email verification and account recovery are not yet implemented. New accounts are not gated on confirmed email; complete verification and recovery workflows before relying on email ownership for sensitive account changes.
- Malware scanning and isolated document conversion/rendering remain deployment hardening requirements; do not treat file-signature validation as malware protection.
